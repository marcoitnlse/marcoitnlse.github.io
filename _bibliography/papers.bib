   abstract = {Complex life-cycles – that is, organismal development that unfolds across ecological niches – are pervasive in nature. In this work we set out to investigate the effects of complex life-cycles on the potential for diversification via evolutionary branching. We did this by analyzing a mathematical model of a consumer with two life-stages, each of which is characterized by a specific feeding efficiency trait that undergoes evolutionary change in response to ecological conditions such as resource competition. We find (i) that life-cycle complexity can favor diversification when compared to simple life-cycles, as there is a larger potential for evolutionary branching in the trait of the life-stage that has a higher population density; (ii) that evolution favors character displacement to minimize intra-stage resource competition; and (iii) that under certain parameters more than one evolutionary branching event can occur.

   abstract = {Most animals undergo ontogentic niche shifts during their life. Yet, standard ecological theory builds on models that ignore this complexity. Here, we study how complex life cycles, where juvenile and adult individuals each feed on different sets of resources, affect community richness. Two different modes of community assembly are considered: gradual adaptive evolution and immigration of new species with randomly selected phenotypes. We find that under gradual evolution complex life cycles can lead to both higher and lower species richness when compared to a model of species with simple life cycles that lack an ontogenetic niche shift. Thus, complex life cycles do not per se increase the scope for gradual adaptive diversification. However, complex life cycles can lead to significantly higher species richness when communities are assembled trough immigration, as immigrants can occupy isolated peaks of the dynamic fitness landscape that are not accessible via gradual evolution.},

   abstract = {The light-induced reorientation of the cortical microtubule array in dark-grown Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells is a striking example of the dynamical plasticity of the microtubule cytoskeleton. A consensus model, based on katanin-mediated severing at microtubule crossovers, has been developed that successfully describes the onset of the observed switch between a transverse and longitudinal array orientation. However, we currently lack an understanding of why the newly populated longitudinal array direction remains stable for longer times and re-equilibration effects would tend to drive the system back to a mixed orientation state. Using both simulations and analytical calculations, we show that the assumption of a small orientation-dependent shift in microtubule dynamics is sufficient to explain the long-term lock-in of the longitudinal array orientation. Furthermore, we show that the natural alternative hypothesis that there is a selective advantage in severing longitudinal microtubules, is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve cortical array reorientation, but is able to accelerate this process significantly.},

   abstract = {Central to building and reorganizing cytoskeletal arrays is the creation of new polymers. While nucleation has been the major focus of study for new microtubule generation, severing has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to create new polymers, a mechanism recently shown to drive the reorientation of cortical arrays of higher plants in response to blue light perception. As severing produces new plus ends behind the stabilizing GTP-cap, an important and unanswered question is how these are stabilized in vivo to promote net microtubule generation. Here we identify the conserved protein CLASP as a potent stabilizer of new plus ends created by katanin severing and find that CLASP is required for rapid cortical array reorientation. In clasp mutants both rescue of shrinking plus ends and the regrowth of plus ends immediately after severing are reduced, computational modeling reveals that it is the specific stabilization of severed ends that explains CLASP’s function in promoting microtubule amplification by severing and cortical array reorientation.},

   abstract = {The cortical microtubule arrays of higher plants are organized without centrosomes and feature treadmilling polymers that are dynamic at both ends. The control of polymer end stability is fundamental for the assembly and organization of cytoskeletal arrays, yet relatively little is understood about how microtubule minus ends are controlled in acentrosomal microtubule arrays, and no factors have been identified that act at the treadmilling minus ends in higher plants. Here, we identify Arabidopsis thaliana SPI RAL2 (SPR2) as a protein that tracks minus ends and protects them against subunit loss. SPR2 function is required to facilitate the rapid reorientation of plant cortical arrays as stimulated by light perception, a process that is driven by microtubule severing to create a new population of microtubules. Quantitative live-cell imaging and computer simulations reveal that minus protection by SPR2 acts by an unexpected mechanism to promote the lifetime of potential SPR2 severing sites, increasing the likelihood of severing and thus the rapid amplification of the new microtubule array.},

   abstract = {The cortical microtubule array of dark-grown hypocotyl cells of plant seedlings undergoes a striking, and developmentally significant, reorientation upon exposure to light. This process is driven by the exponential amplification of a population of longitudinal microtubules, created by severing events localized at crossovers with the microtubules of the pre-existing transverse array. We present a dynamic one-dimensional model for microtubule amplification through this type of templated severing. We focus on the role of the probability of immediate rescue-after-severing of the newly-created lagging microtubule, observed to be a characteristic feature of the reorientation process. Employing stochastic simulations, we show that in the dynamic regime of unbounded microtubule growth, a finite value of this probability is not required for amplification to occur, but does strongly influence the degree of amplification, and hence the speed of the reorientation process. In contrast, in the regime of bounded microtubule growth, we show that amplification only occurs above a critical threshold. We construct an approximate analytical theory, based on a priori limiting the number of crossover events considered, which allows us to predict the observed critical value of the rescue-after-severing probability with reasonable accuracy.},
